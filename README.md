# HeartFailure_prediction
ðŸ§  Project Overview: Heart Failure Prediction
This project is a machine learning-based classification system to predict the likelihood of heart failure using patient health data.

âœ… Key Components Analyzed
1. Dataset
File used: heart.csv

Features likely include: age, sex, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.

Target variable: Presence or absence of heart disease (typically binary: 0 or 1)

2. Libraries Used
NumPy, Pandas for data manipulation

Matplotlib for visualization

Likely also includes scikit-learn (SVM, Logistic Regression, etc.)

3. Data Processing
Separated features (x) and labels (y)

Might include encoding of categorical variables and normalization (to be confirmed from full code)

4. Model Building
You'll likely have trained models such as:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Splitting the data into training and test sets

5. Evaluation
Used accuracy, confusion matrix, or classification report

Possibly plotted ROC curve or accuracy comparison for different models

ðŸ“Œ In One Line:
Built and evaluated machine learning models to predict heart failure based on clinical data, using techniques like data preprocessing, model training, and performance analysis.
